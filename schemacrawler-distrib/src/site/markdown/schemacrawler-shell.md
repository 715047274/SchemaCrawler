# SchemaCrawler Interactive Shell

SchemaCrawler Interactive Shell is an interactive shell environment that allows you to work with your database metadata. 
You can connect to a database, load the schema metadata catalog, and then execute commands against the metadata.

In order to use SchemaCrawler Interactive Shell, 
download the [latest SchemaCrawler distribution](http://github.com/schemacrawler/SchemaCrawler/releases/). 
Unzip it, and follow instructions in the `shell` example included with the distribution.

Example commands look like:

```sh
connect --server <server> --host <host> --user <host> --password <password> --database <database>
load-catalog --info-level maximum
execute --command list
```

Results of command output can be redirected into a file. You can also generate schema diagrams. 
The schema metadata remains loaded as long as the shell is open, even if the database connection is closed.
